# FilmQueryProject

##Description
FilmQueryApp is an application which allows you to navigate the SDVID database, and retrieve information from that database upon request. When the user runs the program, they are prompted with the option to either search for a movie by id, search for movie by keyword, or quit the program. If you search by Id, the user is prompted to enter an ID number. Once the user enters it, the program will search through the linked database to find a movie with that ID number, and will display information about that film to the user. If the user selects to search by keyword, the program will search through all of the database's film titles, and their descriptions. It will retrieve the information about the matching film, and will display the information to the user. And lastly, should the user select the option to quit the program, the program will display a goodbye message and exit.

##Lessons Learned 
I learned a lot through this program. This was the first thing i've made using any amount of SQL, so there was definitely a lot of learning in that area. The main area, however was in the area of linking the database to the program, and allowing the database to see the SQL which I had written. This was my biggest challenge in this project, but in making this program I came closer to having a really solid understanding of this concept and how to use it effectively.
